          You might saw me jumping, climbing, building and stopping trains. But
          nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why i am learning and
          mastering web development. I will not stop untill I become the Web
          Developer Hero.

          I have worked on various projects, including building a website for a
          local business, developing a mobile app using React Native, and
          creating a web application using Node.js and Express.js. I have also
          contributed to open-source projects and have participated in
          hackathons and competitions.

          They did'n offer me a job. But I made myself as a worthy developer. I
          made their website and showed it to them. I did it. And uploaded the
          content . It was fun working at Progtramming Hero.
